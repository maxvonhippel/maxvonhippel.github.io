### Experience

* **Vigilant Aerospace** `|` Software Developer `12/18` - `Present`
	* Develop detect and avoid technologies integrating ADS-B, MavLink, and Radar for piloted and unpiloted aircraft, enabling the next generation of beyond visual line of sight autonomous navigation.
* **NASA, Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Edwards, CA** `|` Software Engineering Intern `06/18` - `09/18`
	* Worked full-time on enhanced ADS-B with phase modulation for high mach-speed, high-altitude flight, as well as artificial intelligence and computer vision for UAV autonomy in beyond visual line of sight and GPS-denied environments. Worked in `MATLAB`, `Java`, `PowerShell`, and `Python`.
* **NASA** `|` University of Arizona Space Grant Intern `09/17` - `06/18`
	* Worked for Dr. Chris Harig on noise reduction & modeling on Slepian `MATLAB` project, which projects [GRACE gravity data](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/) onto bases of Slepian functions of spherical harmonics in order to model the melting of the polar ice caps.
* **NAU Pathogen Microbiome Institute** `|` Undergraduate Software Engineer `06/17` - `09/17`
	* Worked for Dr. Greg Caporaso on [QIIME 2](http://qiime2.org/), a bioinformatics toolkit for microbiology.  Focused on statistics using `numpy` and `pandas` in `Python3`, and data visualization with a `React`/`Redux` stack in `ES6 Javascript` using `D3.JS`.  Built [Alpha Rarefaction visualizer](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-diversity/pull/128).
* **Kathmandu Living Labs** `|` Software Engineering Intern `10/16` - `12/16`
	* Built open-source [server](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/OSMHistoryServer) and [client](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/NepalOSMHistory) for visualization of contribution metrics for mappers on the OpenStreetMap platform in Nepal.
* **RES3D & Capture Interactive** `|` Software Engineer `10/12` - `10/17`
	* Built and helped build numerous projects in `Unity3D`, `iOS Objective-C`, `ES5 Javascript`, and `Windows C#` incorporating [natural user interfaces](https://vimeo.com/132862551) and [augmented](https://vimeo.com/194551673) and virtual reality systems for clients including [General Electric](http://mxvh.pl/GE/), [Fox Entertainment](https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/31/5946153/x-men-pacific-rim-oculus-rift-comic-con), The Muppets franchise, and BP.  RES3D and Capture Interactive were sister companies during most of my time working at both; they split apart in 2014, and I continue to subcontract on occasion for RES3D.
